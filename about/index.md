I live by the beach with my awesome baby and wife and write software. And I could be writing that software with you!

I've lead technology at startups and I've worked as an individual contributor at larger companies. See the LinkedIn for details. These days I primarily write in Clojure and Rust, but I've spent time with Go and Ruby as well.
