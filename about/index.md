I live far away from the beach with my awesome kids and wife and write software. And I could be writing that software with you!

I've lead technology at startups and I've worked as an individual contributor at larger companies. See the LinkedIn for details. These days I primarily write in Ruby, but I've spent time with Rust, Clojure, and Go as well.
